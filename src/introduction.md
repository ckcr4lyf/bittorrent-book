# Introduction

This book aims to explain how BitTorrent works at a technical level. The first part will cover the networking/protocol at a high level with analogies, and the second part will go a bit more in depth.

## Who is this for?

People who are curious about how BitTorrent works, and are not satisfied with some generic high level defintion like "it works by sharing files via p2p" - but rather how these connections are established, how files are requested, and how we even find the peers in the first place.

I once had all these questions, and spent a lot of my time learning about it from various sources. This is my attempt to combine all that knowledge and present it in a noob-friendly way, yet detailed enough to satisfy a somewhat slightly deeper curiosity.
